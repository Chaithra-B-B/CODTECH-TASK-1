OVERVIEW OF THR PROJECT
PROJECT-EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSISÂ (EDA)

OBJECTIVE

"To develop a machine learning-based fraud detection system capable of identifying fraudulent transactions in financial datasets. The objective is to utilize advanced anomaly detection algorithms, such as Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor, and deep learning models, to accurately detect anomalies while minimizing false positives. This system aims to enhance financial security by providing a robust, scalable solution for real-time fraud prevention."

KEY ACTIVITIES

1. Data Collection and Preprocessing 
   - Gather and clean financial transaction datasets.  
   - Handle missing values, normalize/scale features, and encode categorical data.  

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
   - Analyze dataset distribution, identify class imbalance, and visualize key features.  
   - Detect outliers and correlations for deeper insights.  

3. Model Selection and Implementation
   - Experiment with machine learning algorithms like Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor.  
   - Implement deep learning models (e.g., autoencoders) for advanced anomaly detection.  

4. Model Training and Evaluation 
   - Split data into training and testing sets.  
   - Evaluate performance using metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.  

5. Optimization and Hyperparameter Tuning  
   - Apply grid search or random search to improve model accuracy.  
   - Handle class imbalance using techniques like SMOTE or undersampling.  

6. System Deployment
   - Integrate the model into a real-time environment.  
   - Ensure scalability and robustness for detecting fraud in live transactions.  

7. Continuous Monitoring and Updates  
   - Monitor model performance over time.  
   - Update the system with new data to adapt to evolving fraud patterns.
